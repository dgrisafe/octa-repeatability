  abstract = {AIMS: To compare the peripapillary vessel density (VD) measurements of high-density (HD) and non-HD optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) scans in normal and glaucoma eyes, and to evaluate the intrasession repeatability of VD measurements of HD scans.
METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 46 normal (33 subjects) and 89 glaucoma (64 patients) eyes underwent 3 HD and 1 non-HD optic nerve head OCTA scans in the same session. Agreement in VD measurements between HD and non-HD scans was assessed using Bland and Altman analysis. Repeatability of the VD measurements of HD scans was assessed using within-subject coefficient of repeatability (CRw) and variation (CVw).
RESULTS: The mean difference in the VDs ranged between 0.7\% (temporal sector VD) and 2.0\% (inferonasal sector VD), with HD scans showing significantly greater VD values than non-HD scans. The 95\% limits of agreement (LoA) in glaucoma eyes ranged between -2.0\% and 5.0\% for whole enface VD and between -4.8\% and 9.6\% for superotemporal VD. CRw (\%) and CVw (\%) of VD measurements of HD scans ranged from 3.0 to 4.9 and from 2.0 to 3.1 in normal eyes. The same ranged from 3.2 to 6.7 and from 2.6 to 4.8, respectively, in glaucoma eyes.
CONCLUSIONS: VD of HD scans was higher than that of non-HD scans. The wide 95\% LoA indicates that the VD measurements of HD and non-HD scans cannot be used interchangeably. Test-retest repeatability of VDs on HD scans was as high as 6\%. These results should be considered while using OCTA for longitudinal evaluation of glaucoma.},

  abstract = {AIMS: To compare the intrasession repeatability of peripapillary and macular vessel density measurements of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) in normal and glaucoma eyes, and to evaluate the effect of signal strength of OCTA scans on the repeatability.
METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, three optic nerve head scans each of 65 eyes (30 normal, 35 glaucoma eyes) and three macular scans each of 69 eyes (35 normal, 34 glaucoma eyes) acquired in the same session with OCTA were analysed. Repeatability was assessed using within-subject coefficient of repeatability (CRw) and variation (CVw). Effect of signal strength index (SSI) on repeatability was evaluated with repeated-measures mixed-effects models.
RESULTS: CRw (\%) and CVw (\%) of peripapillary measurements in normal eyes ranged between 3.3 and 7.0, and 2.5 and 4.4 respectively, and that in glaucoma eyes between 3.5 and 7.1, and 2.6 and 6.6. For the macular, these measurements ranged between 4.1 and 6.0, and 3.3 and 4.7 in normal eyes and 4.3 and 6.9, and 3.7 and 5.6 in glaucoma eyes. Repeatability estimates of most measurements were similar in normal and glaucoma eyes. Vessel densities of both peripapillary and macular regions significantly increased with increase in SSI of repeat scans (coefficients ranging from 0.15 to 0.38, p{$<$}0.01 for all associations).
CONCLUSIONS: Repeatability estimates of OCTA measured peripapillary and macular vessel densities were similar in normal eyes and eyes with glaucoma. SSI values of the scans had a significant effect on the repeatability of OCTA with the vessel density values increasing in scans with higher SSI values.},
